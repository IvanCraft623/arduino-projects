## 📃 Description
So I am in my beginnings with C++, what better way to combine it than starting also in the world of circuits?

Here you will find my projects that I considered that they were not so garbage as to leave them forgotten in my pc. Feel free to open a Pull Request or issue in case you find ways to improve them.
